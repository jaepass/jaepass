Ciao, I'm Jaeriah, a Software Engineer currently working at cloud marketplace platform organization. Coming from a diverse and non-traditional career path, I've never felt more at home in tech. The very idea that I get to brew up ideas, design the product, and build it all from scratch, had me thinking this is the kind of super power I need!

In my day to day, I spend it mostly doing full-stack software implementation and learning to build backend services. Previous to my current role, I was a Front-end Developer & UI Designer where I contributed to the core product and design system using Vue.js, built integrations using React and Next.js, and designed the UI, graphics and icons. My tech and design stack includes JavaScript, React, Python, AWS, and Figma. Check out some of my projects on my GitHub.

Away from pushing pixels at work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with family, doing Muay Thai 🥊, 🚴 biking‍, 💬 engaging with the developer community, 🗺️ traveling to feed my soul, brewing up product ideas and getting lost behind pages on psychology, philosophy, social science and science fiction 📚. I speak three languages 🇨🇦🇸🇬🇮🇹 but realistically, I call myself a try-lingual. I am a huge advocate for climate awareness, women/girls in tech, and racial injustice.
