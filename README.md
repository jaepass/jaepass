I'm a **Frontend Developer & Designer** currently building 💻 and designing 🖌️ product at [Chec/Commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/). Coming from a diverse career journey, I've never felt more at home in tech, especially in my current kickass startup company. I spend most of my days implementing UI features, building integrations with our tool and writing documentations and tutorials on them, and creating icons and illustrations. I am also a newly joined Canadian Chapter Leader at [Frontend Foxes](https://www.frontendfoxes.org/) 🦊. We run events, meetups, and workshops for women and people who identify a women who want to learn frontend technologies.

Away from pushing pixels at work, I love engaging with the developer community 💬, biking 🚴‍, bookmarking articles I'll never read 🔖, swimming in lakes 🏊🏻‍, traveling 🗺️, and slinging back espresso shots ☕. I also speak three languages 🇨🇦🇸🇬🇮🇹, well more or less, I prefer to call myself try-lingual.

Let's [get in touch](https://twitter.com/jaeriahtay), would love to know what interesting things you all are building out there!
